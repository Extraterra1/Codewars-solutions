// Trilingual democracy
// Switzerland has four official languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansh.1

// When native speakers of one or more of these languages meet, they follow certain regulations to choose a language for the group.2 Here are the rules for groups of exactly three3 people:4

// When all three are native speakers of the same language, it also becomes their group's language.5a

// When two are native speakers of the same language, but the third person speaks a different language, all three will converse in the minority language.5b

// When native speakers of three different languages meet, they eschew these three languages and instead use the remaining of the four official languages.5c

// The languages are encoded by the letters D for Deutsch, F for FranÃ§ais, I for Italiano, and K for Rumantsch.6
